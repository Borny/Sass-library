# Sass Library

## This is a custom library using HTLM 5 and CSS 3

## This library contains : 

- A Grid system based on a 12 columns count
- A navigation using checkbox input
- Tabs using radio inputs 
- Modals using checkbox inputs
- Inputs with an animation on focus

### Grid system

The Grid system used here is based on a 12 columns count and uses media-queries.

The **container** class contains all the columns and goes up to 1200px max-width.
The **row** class is needed to keep the structure together, it uses float: none so the columns don't mess the layout.

Use the class name col-xs- / col-sm- / col-md- / col-lg- and a number that defines the column's length.
There can be as many as 12 columns but the total must be 12 otherwise the extra column will be stacked underneath.

### Navigation

### Tabs

The **tabs** can be set up using radio inputs
